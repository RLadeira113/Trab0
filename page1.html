      <p>Why Should I Study Information Systems?</p>
      <p>
        You are part of the most connected generation in history: You have grown
        up online; you are, quite literally, never out of touch; you use more
        information technologies (in the form of digital devices), for more
        tasks, and are bombarded with more information, than any generation in
        history. The MIT Technology Review refers to you as Homo conexus.
        Information technologies are so deeply embedded in your lives that your
        daily routines would be almost unrecognizable to a college student just
        20 years ago.
      </p>
      <p class="idented">
        Essentially, you practice continuous computing, surrounded by a movable
        information network. This network is created by constant cooperation
        between the digital devices you carry (e.g., laptops, media players, and
        smartphones); the wired and wireless networks that you access as you
        move about; and Web-based tools for fi nding information and
        communicating and collaborating with other people. Your network enables
        you to pull information about virtually anything from anywhere, at any
        time, and to push your own ideas back to the Web, from wherever you are,
        via a mobile device. Think of everything you do online, often with your
        smart phone: register for classes; take classes (and not just at your
        university); access class syllabi, information, PowerPoints, and
        lectures; research class papers and presentations; conduct banking; pay
        your bills; research, shop, and buy products from companies or other
        people; sell your “stuff”; search for, and apply for, jobs; make your
        travel reservations (hotel, airline, rental car); create your own blog
        and post your own podcasts and videocasts to it; design your own page on
        Facebook; make and upload videos to YouTube; take, edit, and print your
        own digital photographs; “burn” your own custom-music CDs and DVDs; use
        RSS feeds to create your personal electronic newspaper; text and tweet
        your friends and family throughout your day; and many other activities.
        (Note: If any of these terms are unfamiliar to you, don’t worry. You
        will learn about everything mentioned here in detail later in this
        text.)
      </p>
      <p>The Informed User—You!</p>
      <p>
        So, the question is: Why you should learn about information systems and
        information technologies? After all, you can comfortably use a computer
        (or other electronic devices) to perform many activities, you have been
        surfi ng the Web for years, and you feel confi dent that you can manage
        any IT application that your organization’s MIS department installs.
      </p>
      <p class="idented">
        The answer lies in your becoming an informed user; that is, a person
        knowledgeable about information systems and information technology.
        There are several reasons why you should be an informed user.
      </p>
      <p class="idented">
        In general, informed users tend to get more value from whatever
        technologies they use. You will enjoy many benefi ts from being an
        informed user of IT.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          First, you will benefi t more from your organization’s IT applications
          because you will understand what is “behind” those applications (see
          <a href="#Figure-1-1">Figure 1.1</a>). That is, what you see on your
          computer screen is brought to you by your MIS department, who are
          operating “behind” your screen.
        </li>
        <li>
          Second, you will be in a position to enhance the quality of your
          organization’s IT applications with your input
        </li>
        <li>
          Third, even as a new graduate, you will quickly be in a position to
          recommend—and perhaps help select—the IT applications that your
          organization will use.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fourth, being an informed user will keep you abreast of both new
          information technologies and rapid developments in existing
          technologies. Remaining “on top of things” will help you to anticipate
          the impacts that “new and improved” technologies will have on your
          organization and to make recommendations on the adoption and use of
          these technologies.
        </li>
        <li>
          Fifth, you will understand how using IT can improve your
          organization’s performance and teamwork as well as your own
          productivity.
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, if you have ideas of becoming an entrepreneur, then being an
          informed user will help you use IT when you start your own business.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p class="idented">
        Going further, managing the IS function within an organization is no
        longer the exclusive responsibility of the IS department. Rather, users
        now play key roles in every step of this process. The overall objective
        in this text is to provide you with the necessary information to
        contribute immediately to managing the IS function in your organization.
        In short, the goal is to help you become a very informed user!
      </p>
      <p>IT Offers Career Opportunities</p>
      <p>
        Because information technology is vital to the operation of modern
        businesses, it offers many employment opportunities. The demand for
        traditional IT staff—programmers, business analysts, systems analysts,
        and designers—is substantial. In addition, many well-paid jobs exist in
        areas such as the Internet and electronic commerce (e-commerce), mobile
        commerce (m-commerce), network security, telecommunications, and
        multimedia design.

      <p>Overview of Computer-Based Information Systems</p>
      <p>
        Organizations refer to their management information systems functional
        area by several names, including the MIS Department, the Information
        Systems (IS) Department, the Information Technology Department, and the
        Information Services Department. Regardless of the name, however, this
        functional area deals with the planning for—and the development,
        management, and use of—information technology tools to help people
        perform all the tasks related to information processing and management.
        Recall that information technology relates to any computer-based tool
        that people use to work with information and to support the information
        and information processing needs of an organization.
      </p>
      <p class="idented">
        As previously stated, an information system collects, processes, stores,
        analyzes, and disseminates information for a specifi c purpose. The
        purpose of information systems has been defi ned as getting the right
        information to the right people, at the right time, in the right amount,
        and in the right format. Because information systems are intended to
        supply useful information, we need to differentiate between information
        and two closely related terms: data and knowledge (see Figure 1.2).
      </p>
      <p class="idented">
        <strong>Data items</strong> refer to an elementary description of
        things, events, activities, and transactions that are recorded, classifi
        ed, and stored but are not organized to convey any specifi c meaning.
        Data items can be numbers, letters, fi gures, sounds, and images.
        Examples of data items are collections of numbers (e.g., 3.11, 2.96,
        3.95, 1.99, 2.08) and characters (e.g., B, A, C, A, B, D, F, C)
      </p>
      <p class="idented">
        <strong>Information</strong> refers to data that have been organized so
        that they have meaning and value to the recipient. For example, a grade
        point average (GPA) by itself is data, but a student’s name coupled with
        his or her GPA is information. The recipient interprets the meaning and
        draws conclusions and implications from the information. Consider the
        examples of data provided in the preceding paragraph. Within the context
        of a university, the numbers could be grade point averages, and the
        letters could be grades in an Introduction to MIS class.
      </p>
      <p class="idented">
        <strong>Knowledge</strong> consists of data and/or information that have
        been organized and processed to convey understanding, experience,
        accumulated learning, and expertise as they apply to a current business
        problem. For example, suppose that a company recruiting at your school
        has found over time that students with grade point averages over 3.0
        have experienced the greatest success in its management program. Based
        on this accumulated knowledge, that company may decide to interview only
        those students with GPAs over 3.0. This example presents an example of
        knowledge because the company utilizes information—GPAs—to address a
        business problem—hiring successful employees. As you can see from this
        example, organizational knowledge, which refl ects the experience and
        expertise of many people, has great value to all employees.
